            This document describes the <em>perceptible</em> differences between three HTML
            specifications:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <a href='http://whatwg.org/html'>WHATWG HTML LS</a> —
              The HTML Living Standard as maintained by the WHATWG
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href='http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/'>W3C HTML 5.1</a> —
              The HTML Nightly document, targeted for standardisation by W3C in 2016.
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href='http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/CR/'>W3C HTML 5.0</a> —
              The HTML 5.0 document, currently in Candidate Recommendation and targeted for
              standardisation by W3C in 2014.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This document does not currently take into account
            <a href='http://www.w3.org/html/wg/wiki/ExtensionSpecifications'>extension 
            specifications</a> (longdesc, 2D context...) currently being developed by the HTML WG.
            They may be included in future updates after discussion in the working group.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Perceptible" differences are substantive changes but not editorial details. (Example:
            an attribute that's not present in one specification would be listed along with whatever
            other pieces of the specification that it affects, but its absence from the appendix
            would not be accounted for.)
          </p>
          <p>
            This document is updated on a regular basis based on the stream of commits made in the
            git repository. A more thorough update pass is made about every 6 months to ensure that
            nothing has been overlooked. Patches and bug reports are welcome at any time.
          </p>
          <p>
            All differences are categorised as: "user agent" (for those that change UA behaviour),
            "validity" (that affect the validity of a document but not its behaviour), "author
            advice" (for non-normative advice given to authors but isn't typically validated for,
            usually because it's not possible), and "opinion" (the impact is unclear or hard to 
            assess but the difference stems from disagreement nevertheless).
          </p>
          <p>
            Each difference has a rationale for its existence. The rationale is intended to be
            succinct (no need to rehash discussions taking place elsewhere) and to simply state its
            cause.

    <!--
      Where differences between 5.1 and 5.0 are concerned, the primary rationale is whether a given feature is rough-and-ready implemented broadly enough to enable its inclusion in a Recommendation published in 2014.

      Rationales for differences between WHATWG and 5.1 will be broadly classified based on the following list. It is not meant to be exhaustive, but rationales not in this list will follow its general style.

      • Feedback from the {accessibility, internationalisation, privacy, security} community indicates that this is their preferred approach, but the {WHATWG, HTMLWG} disagrees.
      • Broad feedback from {users, developers} indicate that they prefer this approach, but the {WHATWG, HTMLWG} disagrees that {this is an improvement, that the feedback is accurate, that this is sufficient to justify a modification when taking some other aspect into account}.
      • The {WHATWG, HTMLWG} has not {discussed this, reached agreement, accepted the change} yet.
      • The {WHATWG, HTMLWG} is waiting for further feedback {from $constituency} on this aspect.
      • This is non-normative advice that the {WHATWG, HTMLWG} does not believe is relevant.
      • The {WHATWG, HTMLWG} does not believe this feature meets the high bar for inclusion in the Web platform.

      Rationales for differences between WHATWG and 5.1 are essentially a union of the above.
